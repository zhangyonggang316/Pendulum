# Pendulum
This is pendulum by simulink and ESP32 for real project!
# First
I can make pendulum CAD model by Fusion360. The model is used to indefinite structure at this real project pendulum .
# Second,
I can do some simulation by simulink or matlab. Simulation is a good way to predict direct action for pendulum controller.
# Finally
Control algorithm can generate C code , and ESP32 can be settled some app. they are combined into controller. The integrated pendulum is done.
